* *Team over individuals*: no code/infra silos, everyone should be able to do anything
* *Code over arguments*: doesn't matter how much you discuss something, if it fails in a PoC, it's not valid
* *Decisions*: are like fresh dairy products, it expires for sure after a period of time. Decisions normally shouldn't be taken by one indivdual, but the whole team. If no consensus can be reached, PoC the options if possible, or just go with one and adjust later 
* *Wheels*: don't re-invent them. If you can buy a solution to a problem, writing your own should be secondary
* *Leading by (my) example*: very much hands-on but still wrapping my head around the bigger picture
* *Get shit done*: code in production over a perfect first solution
* *Deadlines*: never, unless you want bad code

## Experience
### Schibsted 2013 Jan - now
#### 2018 June - now
Tech Lead / Software Engineer / Data Engineer in Media Products & Technology / Insights

New team, with the mission to centralize access to Schibsted's data. Working with Snowflake as a data warehouse, loaded via Airflow Python jobs, integrating with all Schibsted's data sources. Kafka to provide fast event stream transformations of data. This job very much includes listening to the media sites problems and helping them solve it centrally, and once for all sites. 

    
#### 2015 Dec - 2018 June
Tech Lead / Software Engineer in Schibsted Products & Technology / Core News Product / Create 

Technical Lead with hands-on code development for the team. Overall system architectural guard, team process, and roadmap planning responsabilites, working closely with the Product Manager. 


#### 2014 Jan - 2015 Dec
Software Engineer in Schibsted Products & Technology / Core News Product / Create 

Rolling out the CMS (Create) to other news-sites in Schibsted. Support in migration, and adding features. Running fully on Amazon AWS, and other Cloud services. The system is built up of small scoped services communicating via REST APIs and AWS SNS/SQS. The Java services are kept small and lightweight without any bloated frameworks. Smaller frameworks like DropWizard was used consistently. All team members could do everything in code and infra/DevOps. Everyone that pushed code to production was in the on-call rotation. Pushing code was as simple as merging a pull request, and clicking a `release` button. 


#### 2013 Jan - 2013 Dec
Backend Engineer at Schibsted Sverige / Omni

Birth of the Omni app and the Schibsted internal CMS tool (Create) and news discovery tool (Discover). Java backend, and Javascript frontend, running on Cloud servers. Worked with scraping massive number of articles from many news sites to present articles in a collected, filterable and searchable way to the redactors. Also worked with a publishing pipeline of articles, with different enrichments and format evolvement. We experimented with a more lightweight Kanban process, based on priorities, and quality over deadlines. 


### IGT
#### 2012 Apr - 2012 Dec
Backend System Developer

Poker network built in Java, with skinned clients for Poker sites. Wanted the challenge to work with a many-users system. The company planned a release in America. Turned out a law relief didn't happen, and the Poker hype was already over, so the Swedish part of the company was shortly shut down after I started. 

Here I learned how NOT to do development and releases. Everyone worked alone, and a release was package and tested for several weeks before going into production.  


### Keybroker
#### 2007 Jan - 2012 Mar
Full stack System Developer

My first job in IT. Classic Java Spring application, with a Javascript frontend. The tool published ads to Google and Facebook, and collected impressions, clicks, and conversion data for the analysts. Worked with everything from frontend to backend to data loading and transformations. Started to experiment with Continuous Deployment. 


## Education
#### 2002 Aug - 2006 Dec
Master's degree in Computer Science (160 old Swedish points, 240 ECTS points, 4 years). Prolonged one semester because of parental leave. 

Final thesis was a D-level (20 old Swedish points) solo project, where I developed a computer graphics-engine for rendering water-waves in real-time based on approximations of water's physical properties. I found a simple way to bend the waves so they align towards land in the simulation. The application was implemented in C++ with OpenGL. My supervisor was Thomas Larsson at MDH, and he helped me to write, submit and present a short version of the report to [SIGRAD 2007](http://www.ep.liu.se/ecp/028/), it was accepted. Unfortunately I could not attend the presentation.
