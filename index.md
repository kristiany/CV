* Team over individuals
* Code over arguments: doesn't matter how much you discuss something, if it fails in a PoC, it's not valid
* Decisions: are like fresh dairy products, it expires for sure after a period of time. Decisions normally shouldn't be taken by one indivdual, but the whole team. If no consensus can be reached, PoC the options if possible, or just go with one and adjust later 
* Wheels: don't re-invent them. If you can buy a solution to a problem, writing your own should be secondary
* Leading by (my) example: very much hands-on but still wrapping my head around the bigger picture
* Get shit done: code in production over a perfect first solution

## Education
#### 2002 Aug - 2006 Dec
Master's degree in Computer Science (160 old Swedish points, 240 ECTS points, 4 years). Prolonged one semester because of parental leave. 

Final thesis was a D-level (20 old Swedish points) solo project, where I developed a computer graphics-engine for rendering water-waves in real-time based on approximations of water's physical properties. I found a simple way to bend the waves so they align towards land in the simulation. The application was implemented in C++ with OpenGL. My supervisor was Thomas Larsson at MDH, and he helped me to write and submit a short version of the report to [SIGRAD 2007](http://www.ep.liu.se/ecp/028/), it was accepted and presented. Unfortunately I could not attend the presentation.
